# PS5 Package Format — Technical Write-up

This document describes the structure of a PS5 package and the end-to-end
process LibProsperoPkg follows to create one. It is a technical write-up for developers working
with the format; the offsets and field names below match the library's own reader, builder and
finalizer.

> Endianness is mixed: the outer container (`\x7FCNT`) header is **big-endian**, while the
> finalized-image (`\x7FFIH`) header fields are **little-endian**. This is called out per section.

---

## 1. Overview

A complete, installable PS5 package is a **finalized image** with the magic `\x7FFIH`. It wraps
a **metadata container** with the magic `\x7FCNT`,
together with a shared, encrypted **PFS** image holding the actual
application files.

At the highest level a finished package is four consecutive segments:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ FIH   header + finalization digest table   (0x00000–0x10000)  │  little-endian
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ PFS   shared AES-XTS-encrypted outer PFS image                │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ SC    embedded \x7FCNT metadata container                     │  big-endian header
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ SI    install-metadata archive                                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The console reports these segments as **FIH / PFS / SC / SI**.

## 2. The metadata container (`\x7FCNT`)

The `\x7FCNT` container holds the package metadata: the entry table, the content id, and the
descriptor entries (param.json, icons, PlayGo data, license, digests, keys, …). It is metadata
only — by itself it is **not** an installable package.

### 2.1 Header (big-endian)

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Magic | `0x7F 'C' 'N' 'T'` |
| Flags | Container flags |
| Entry count | Number of records in the entry table |
| Entry-table offset | File offset of the first entry-meta record |
| Body offset / size | Region holding the entry payloads |
| Content ID | 36-character ASCII identifier, stored in a `0x30`-byte field |
| DRM type / content type | Package classification |

The container header region is `0x5A0` bytes.

### 2.2 Entry table

The entry table is an array of fixed-size **`0x20`-byte** records. Each record describes one
entry:

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Id | A well-known entry id (see below) |
| Name-table offset | Offset of the entry's name within the entry name table (`0x0200`) |
| Flags | Includes the encrypted-entry flag (`0x80000000` in `Flags1`) |
| Data offset / size | Location and length of the entry payload |

Entry names are resolved from the `ENTRY_NAMES` table (entry id `0x0200`).

### 2.3 Well-known entry ids

The subset relevant to inspection and
creation:

| Id | Entry |
|---|---|
| `0x0001` | Digests |
| `0x0010` | Entry keys |
| `0x0020` | Image key |
| `0x0080` | General digests |
| `0x0100` | Metas |
| `0x0200` | Entry names |
| `0x0400` / `0x0401` | License data / license info |
| `0x0402` / `0x0403` / `0x0404` | `nptitle.dat` / `npbind.dat` / `selfinfo.dat` |
| `0x0407` / `0x0408` | `target-deltainfo.dat` / `origin-deltainfo.dat` |
| `0x040A` | `imagedigs.dat` (**unnamed** entry) — `N × 32` outer-block digest table |
| `0x1001` | `playgo-chunk.dat` |
| `0x1004` / `0x1005` | `pronunciation.xml` / `pronunciation.sig` |
| `0x1007` | `pubtoolinfo.dat` |
| `0x1200` / `0x1220` / `0x1240` | `icon0.png` / `pic0.png` / `snd0.at9` |
| `0x1260`+ | `changeinfo/changeinfo.xml` (and `changeinfo_NN.xml`) |
| `0x1280` / `0x12A0` / `0x12C0` / `0x2060` | `icon0.dds` / `pic0.dds` / `pic1.dds` / `pic2.dds` |
| `0x1600`+ | `keymap_rp/...` Remote Play key-map images |
| `0x2000` | `param.json` |
| `0x2010` / `0x2011` | `playgo-hash-table.dat` / `playgo-ficm.dat` |

> A `nwonly` debug CNT carries 13 entries:
> `0x0001 0x0010 0x0020 0x0080 0x0100 0x0200 0x040A 0x1001 0x1200 0x1280 0x2000 0x2010 0x2011`
> (no license entries). `imagedigs.dat` (`0x040A`) is the only **unnamed** body entry. The
> license, network-platform, self-info, delta-info, keymap_rp, changeinfo and pronunciation entries
> are added only when the source folder supplies those files (see §8.1).

## 3. The PFS image

The application's files live inside a **PFS** image. There are two
nested images:

- The **inner image** holds the actual file tree (`uroot`): `sce_sys/`, `eboot.bin`, data, etc.
- The **outer image** wraps the inner image (optionally compressed) plus the metadata, and is
  the segment the finalized image points to.

### 3.1 Layout

The inner PFS image is laid out from the prepared folder:

1. The folder tree is walked and turned into PFS directory and file inodes.
2. Inode tables, the directory structure and the data region are written.
3. A superblock records the image geometry and the format version (always 2 for PS5).

The resulting plaintext image round-trips through the reader through the PFS reader.

### 3.2 Merkle integrity

PFS protects its data with a **SHA-256 Merkle** hash tree: each block's hash rolls up through
parent levels to a root, so any tampering is detectable. This is built as part of the image.

### 3.3 Encryption (AES-XTS)

The image is encrypted with **AES-XTS** over **`0x1000`-byte (4 KiB) sectors**:

1. The **EKPFS** (encrypted-key PFS) roots the key schedule. For the **inner PFS image**, the
   EKPFS is derived from the content id and passcode using SHA3-256. For the **shared outer
   finalized-image PFS**, the EKPFS is the `pfs-image-key` stored in the package metadata (it
   is *not* the passcode-derived inner key) and is consumed directly.
2. From the EKPFS and the 16-byte superblock **seed**, the per-image key material (tweak key,
   data key, sign key) is derived using the SHA3-256-based `new_crypt` key schedule.

   The XTS sector number is the **image-relative** sector index (the first encrypted sector is
   tweak 0), with a `0x1000` sector size.
3. Every sector except the plaintext header block is encrypted; the encryption flag and the
   seed are stamped in the superblock.

`Util/Crypto.cs` (`PfsGenCryptoKey`/`PfsGenEncKey`/`PfsGenSignKey`) implements this
schedule.

The header (block 0) stays plaintext because the kernel needs to read the superblock before it
has the keys. The encrypted image decrypts back to the original image.

### 3.4 Compression (PFSC)

The inner image can optionally be stored as a **PFSC** container — a block-compressed form that
substantially reduces the dominant size driver (`pfs_image.dat`). Each block is compressed
independently; incompressible blocks (and incompressible images as a whole) fall back to a raw
wrapper. A PFSC image decompresses back to a valid, mountable inner PFS.

---

## 4. Metadata signing

The package metadata is signed with **RSA-3072, PKCS#1 v1.5, SHA-256**. The same key material
drives the EKPFS/PFS key derivation used for the inner-image encryption. The signer verifies the
published key fingerprint and performs a sign/verify round-trip before use.

---

## 5. The finalized image (`\x7FFIH`)

Finalization wraps the `\x7FCNT` container and the shared PFS image into the installable
`\x7FFIH` image.

### 5.1 Header (little-endian)

| Offset | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `0x00` | Magic | `0x7F 'F' 'I' 'H'` |
| `0x05` | Signed byte | `0x00` = debug, `0x80` = retail/submitted |
| `0x10` | PFS image offset | u64; always `0x10000` |
| `0x18` | PFS image size | u64 |
| `0x58` | Embedded CNT (SC) offset | u64 |
| `0xA0` | Embedded CNT (SC) size | u64 |

The header + digest-table region is always **`0x10000`** bytes, and the PFS segment always
begins at `0x10000`. The FIH offset (`0`) and FIH size (`0x10000`) are constant; only the
segment sizes vary.

### 5.2 The signed byte

The single byte at offset `0x05` is what distinguishes a **debug** finalized image (`0x00`)
from a **retail/submitted** one (`0x80`). A console in debug mode relaxes finalized-image
verification and accepts the debug variant.

### 5.3 Finalization digest table

The remainder of the FIH region holds the finalized digests. The `game-digest` (`0x30`/`0x70`/`0xD0`)
is `SHA3-256` of the plaintext outer superblock, and the embedded CNT carries the package-digest
self-seal, the CNT-header rollup, the per-entry digest table and the GeneralDigests block
(content/header/system/param/playgo/target). LibProsperoPkg computes these values from the finalized CNT and image data.
The FIH `0xB0` slot is `SHA3-256` of the **uncompressed inner PFS image** at its plain size and is threaded through the build path.
See [implementation-status.md](implementation-status.md).

### 5.4 The SI segment

The image ends with a trailing **STORED ZIP** archive of install-time metadata (every member
uncompressed / `STORED`), in this member order:

| Path | Notes |
|---|---|
| `common/etc/naps_meta_18.dat` | per-package metric blob (AES-128-XTS TLV), built by `ProsperoNapsMeta.BuildMeta18` over the finalized image and its content-file table; size scales with the file table and outer-block count. |
| `common/etc/naps_meta_300.dat` | 48 B; generated from inner-image geometry (`R = alignUp(pfs_image.dat) - 0x10000` at 0x10/0x20, kind id `0x3E9` at 0x18, block size `0x10000` at 0x28) |
| `common/etc/naps_meta_301.dat` | 48 B, same structure as `_300` |
| `common/etc/naps_meta_302.dat` | 48 B, same structure as `_300` |
| `common/etc/naps_meta_308.dat` | 48 B, same structure as `_300` |
| `common/etc/pfsimage.xml` | machine-readable image descriptor (see below) |
| `common/etc/playgo-chunk.dat` | 416 B; identical to the CNT `0x1001` copy |
| `config/<content-id>/playgo-chunk.crc` | CRC-32C per 64 KiB block of the mount image |

The SI segment is **emitted automatically** by the `nwonly` build: `ProsperoPkgBuilder` captures the
deterministic `pfsimage.xml` options, the CNT `playgo-chunk.dat`, and the block-aligned inner-image size
during the CNT build, and `ProsperoFihBuilder.BuildFromCnt` appends the ZIP produced by
`ProsperoSiArchive.BuildDebugSiSegment` after the embedded CNT. `BuildMembers` → `WriteZip` writes the
member order, paths, `STORED` framing and `naps_meta_30x` identity exactly; the `playgo-chunk.crc` is
recomputed from the finalized mount image (CRC-32C). The `naps_meta_300` `R` is the inner-image
data-region size and is legitimately `0` when the inner image fits in one 0x10000 block (tiny
inputs); real multi-MB application content yields the expected non-zero value (for example `0x40000`).

`pfsimage.xml` is generated through its `<config>`, `<digests>`, `<params>`,
`<container>`, `<mount-image>` and `<entries>` sections — including the version constants
`<version-date>0x20200722</version-date>` / `<version-hash>0x01fe52e9</version-hash>`, the derived
`<longname>`, the full container/mount geometry and the CNT entry table, all populated with the build's
own self-consistent digests. The deep `<chunkinfo>`/`<pfs-image>` (outer PFS) / `<nested-image>` (inner
PFS) introspection trees are emitted as well, walked from the build's own captured outer/inner inode
layout (`ProsperoPfsBuilder.CaptureImageTree`). They describe the library's generated image: the outer superblock `<icv>` is the captured superblock HMAC
and the `<seed>` is all-zero. Because the builder writes a superblock-first outer PFS, the reported block indices and metadata offsets reflect that layout. The nested
`<metadata>` pseudo-element and per-file `poffset` are intentionally omitted. Inner `sce_sys` files packed
as outer CNT entries (e.g. `icon0.png`) receive no inner inode and are correctly absent from the
`<nested-image>` tree. These trees are informational metadata that the console loader does not read.
The `naps_meta_18.dat` metric blob is built by `ProsperoNapsMeta.BuildMeta18` from the finalized image
and its content-file table. See [implementation-status.md](implementation-status.md).

---

## 6. End-to-end creation process

Putting the pieces together, the library builds a package as follows:

1. **Validate inputs** — content id (36 chars), title id, and passcode (32 chars). Optionally generate a minimal `param.json` if the source folder
   lacks one. When `ApplicationType` is set, the generated `param.json` carries the matching
   `applicationDrmType` (`free` / `standard` / `freemium`).
2. **Fake-sign modules (optional)** — when `FakeSignSelfModules` is set, convert each raw ELF in
   the source tree (`eboot.bin`, `*.elf`, `*.prx`, `*.sprx`) to fake-self in place. Files that are
   already SELF are skipped. The original bytes are restored after the build so the source folder
   is left unchanged.
3. **Generate auxiliary `sce_sys` files** — `about/right.sprx`, `playgo-chunk.dat`,
   `playgo-manifest.xml`, and the BC7 DDS siblings of the icon/picture images — so the file set
   is complete.
4. **Lay out the inner PFS** — walk the folder into a plaintext inner-PFS image with the SHA-256
   Merkle tree and the correct (PS5) superblock version.
5. **Render the inner image** — leave it plaintext, **AES-XTS-encrypt** it with the EKPFS
   (the `pfs-image-key`; §3.3), or **PFSC-compress** it.
6. **Build the outer PFS + `\x7FCNT`** — assemble the metadata container, the entry table and
   the entry-name table around the inner image. Any backend-authored system file supplied under
   `sce_sys/` (license, network-platform, self-info, delta-info, keymap_rp, changeinfo,
   pronunciation, trophy; §8.1) is added here as an outer CNT entry with its fixed id.
7. **Sign the metadata** — RSA-3072 / SHA-256.
8. **Finalize** — wrap the container and shared PFS image into a `\x7FFIH` **debug** image
   (signed byte `0x00`), writing the FIH header and the segment offsets/sizes.

The result round-trips through `ProsperoPkgReader` as a full debug image whose embedded
container and shared PFS image are intact.

## 8. `sce_sys` / `sce_suppl` metadata files

These auxiliary files fall into two groups. `imagedigs.dat` and the PlayGo files (`playgo-chunk.dat`,
`playgo-hash-table.dat`, `playgo-ficm.dat`) are **outer-CNT body entries** — they live in the `\x7FCNT`
container metadata, NOT inside the inner PFS image. (An extractor presents them under a `sce_sys/` view,
which historically caused them to be modelled as inner-PFS files; they are not.) The `sce_suppl/common/etc`
SI archive (`naps_meta_*`, the second `playgo-chunk.dat` copy, `pfsimage.xml`) is a separate supplemental
stream. CNT-entry placement for each file is described below.

| File | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `imagedigs.dat` | CNT entry `0x040A` (unnamed) | `N × 32` byte digest table, one entry per 64 KiB **outer** image block (e.g. 11 blocks = 352 B). The outer-PFS builder captures the per-block descriptor digests of the finalized outer image (`CaptureImageDigests`), and the builder patches them into the entry after `WriteImage`. Each stored 32-byte digest is written in opposite byte order. Because it digests the outer image but does **not** live in it, there is no self-dependency / fixpoint; the build is single-pass and the entry size (`outerBlocks × 32`) is known up front. |
| `playgo-chunk.dat` | CNT entry `0x1001` **and** `sce_suppl/common/etc` (SI) | 416-byte PlayGo chunk descriptor. Both copies contain the same payload. Generated by `PlayGo.ProsperoPlayGo.BuildChunkDat`. |
| `playgo-hash-table.dat` | CNT entry `0x2010` | PlayGo file hash table; `0x38 + n × 8` bytes (n = `ficmCount / 2`). A content-independent constant structure (version=1, `\x7FFLT` magic at `0x18`, fixed 16-byte prefix + `n × 8` constant table entries). `PlayGo.ProsperoPlayGo.BuildHashTable`. |
| `playgo-ficm.dat` | CNT entry `0x2011` | PlayGo file-in-chunk map; 16-byte header + `fileCount` bytes. `PlayGo.ProsperoPlayGo.BuildFicm`. |
| `playgo-chunk.crc` | `config/<content-id>/` (SI) | CRC-32C over each 64 KiB block of the finalized mount image. `ProsperoPlayGo.BuildChunkCrc`. |
| `naps_meta_18.dat` | `sce_suppl/common/etc` (SI) | Per-package NAPS metric blob (AES-128-XTS TLV); size scales with the content-file table and outer-block count. Built by `ProsperoNapsMeta.BuildMeta18` over the finalized image and its content-file table. |
| `naps_meta_300/301/302/308.dat` | `sce_suppl/common/etc` (SI) | 48-byte NAPS records; `301/302/308` share the `300` record structure. Generated by `ProsperoNapsMeta`. |
| `pfsimage.xml` | `sce_suppl/common/etc` (SI) | Machine-readable image descriptor; includes `<entries>` plus the `<chunkinfo>`/`<pfs-image>`/`<nested-image>` introspection trees (self-consistent; see §5.4). |

> **`naps_pkg_layout.dat`.** For the data-first inner image the builder generates a valid
> `naps_pkg_layout.dat` as an outer-PFS file (alongside `pfs_image.dat`) through
> `ProsperoNwonlyNapsGenerator`; it describes the outer download-stream block layout.
> `ProsperoNapsLayout` is the round-trip serializer/parser this builds on.

### 8.1 Supplied system files

The source folder may contain backend-authored files under `sce_sys/` that carry a fixed CNT id:
`license.dat` / `license.info`, `nptitle.dat`, `npbind.dat`, `selfinfo.dat`,
`origin-deltainfo.dat` / `target-deltainfo.dat`, `pubtoolinfo.dat`, `pronunciation.xml` /
`pronunciation.sig`, `changeinfo/changeinfo*.xml`, the `keymap_rp/` image set, and the `trophy/`
archives.

These are **outer-CNT body entries**, not inner-PFS files: the inner-image builder keeps every
named system file out of the inner PFS, so they are carried in the `\x7FCNT` container instead.
LibProsperoPkg packs each supplied file whose `sce_sys`-relative path maps to a known entry id
(`ProsperoPkgBuilder.CollectMediaEntries`); files that are absent are simply skipped. The payloads
are produced by a signing backend and are stored verbatim — the library does not generate them.

`keymap_rp` uses two path shapes, flat `keymap_rp/0NN.png` and nested `keymap_rp/NN/0NN.png`; each
image is its own CNT entry. The key-map set is capped at 1 MiB total.

Because the standard `nwonly` debug package supplies none of these files, its CNT stays at
13 entries. Each supplied system file adds one entry.

### 8.2 UCP archives (`trophy2/*.ucp`, `uds/*.ucp`)

The trophy set and universal data system are carried as UCP archives inside the inner PFS
(`sce_sys/trophy2/trophyNN.ucp`, `sce_sys/uds/udsNN.ucp`). Unlike the signed system files in §8.1,
UCP archives are inner-PFS files and are fully producible.

A UCP file is a flat container: a `0x60`-byte big-endian header (magic `0xB228C60A`, version 1, total
size, entry count, and a 20-byte SHA-1 digest at `0x1C`) followed by `0x40`-byte entry records
(32-byte name, u64 offset, u64 size) sorted in ascending ordinal name order, then the blobs. Each
blob begins at the next strictly-greater 16-byte boundary after the previous blob's end. The digest
is a plain SHA-1 over the whole file with the digest field zeroed, so it can be verified and repaired
without keys.

`Content.ProsperoUcp` reads, builds (from entries or from a directory), validates, verifies, and
repairs UCP files; rebuilt archives round-trip through the parser. During a build,
`ProsperoPkgBuilder.EnsureUcpArchives` repairs a stale digest on a supplied archive but never
synthesizes its contents.

### 8.3 System-file validation

Before packing, backend-signed files are structurally validated by `PKG.ProsperoSystemFiles`:
`npbind.dat` (532 bytes, magic `0xD294A018`, communication id in the TLV chain at `0x80`) and
`nptitle.dat` (160 bytes, magic `NPTD`, title id at `0x10`) are checked and their identifiers
extracted; `license.dat` / `license.info` require a non-empty payload. A malformed file stops the
build with a descriptive error rather than producing an invalid package.

### 8.4 SELF container and fake-self

`sce_sys/about/right.sprx` is a SELF (Signed ELF) module. `Content.ProsperoFself` parses the SELF
header, segment table, embedded ELF header and program headers, and the extended-info block, and can
generate a fake-self from any 64-bit ELF with `MakeFself`.

The generator emits a digest/data segment pair for each program header whose file size is non-zero and
whose type is `PT_LOAD`, module-data (`0x61000000`), relro (`0x61000010`), or comment (`0x6FFFFF00`),
in program-header index order. The extended-info digest is `SHA-256` of the input ELF; the authority id
and program type are derived from the ELF type and the byte at file offset `0x3f00`; digest and
signature slots are zero-filled. A generated module round-trips through the parser and preserves the
segment layout of the source module. Package builds embed a fixed `right.sprx` asset when the source
provides none (§6); the generator is a standalone capability for arbitrary ELF input.

When `FakeSignSelfModules` is enabled on the build options (§6, step 2), the builder applies
`MakeFself` to every raw ELF module in the source tree before layout — `eboot.bin` and any
`*.elf` / `*.prx` / `*.sprx`. Inputs that are already SELF, or that are not ELF, are skipped. Each
converted file is written in place for the duration of the build and restored to its original bytes
once packing completes, so the resulting fake package embeds fake-self modules while the source
folder is left unmodified. Per-module conversion settings come from `FselfOptions` when supplied.

> **Digest boundary.** The `content` / `game` / `header` / `system` / `param` / `package` / `body` /
> `sblock` / `fixed-info` digests, the superblock `icv`, the per-entry digest table and `imagedigs.dat`
> are all computed by the library as SHA3-256 over the finalized CNT regions and outer image, and are
> self-consistent for a debug image. The fields that need console-side material the library does not
> have are the retail image-key seal, the `rif` key blob, and the encrypted retail finalization
> material; those are emitted as structurally valid placeholders for a debug image and reported as
> warnings.

## 9. License file (`rif`)

A `rif` is a fixed **0x400-byte** record with a big-endian header. Multiple sub-title licences are
concatenated with no container header, so a whole-file size is always a positive multiple of `0x400`
(one record = single content; `N × 0x400` = a set). Layout of one record:

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| `0x00` | 4 | Magic `52 49 46 00` (`RIF\0`). |
| `0x04` | 2 | Version, big-endian (`0x0002`). |
| `0x06` | 2 | Flags, big-endian (commonly `0xFFFF`). |
| `0x14` | 4 | Format tag `51 50 61 43` (`QPaC`). |
| `0x18` | 8 | Expiry / timestamp, big-endian (`0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` = non-expiring). |
| `0x20` | `0x24` | Content-id (36 chars, NUL-trimmed). |
| `0x50` | 8 | Format descriptor (`01 04 00 10 00 20 00 03`). |
| `0x60` | 8 | Entry-count / flag, big-endian (commonly `1`). |
| `0x240` | `0x1C0` | Encrypted key blob (448 bytes). |

`License.ProsperoRif` reads/writes a single record; `License.ProsperoRifSet` handles the
concatenated multi-content case (per-record content-id, service label, `has_app`, `n_ac`, whole-file
size). `License.ProsperoEntitlementKey` carries the 16-byte content key and enforces the
passcode-XOR-content-key selection rule.

> **Keyed-field boundary.** The 448-byte key blob at `0x240` is encrypted with per-device
> material. The header is fully readable and deterministic; the key blob is carried and validated,
> never forged.

---

## 10. Split disc-backup packages (`app_0` + `app_sc`)

A disc backup stores one finalized image split across several piece files, described by an
`app.json` manifest that sits beside them:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `app.json` | Manifest: reassembled `originalFileSize`, the SHA-256 package `digest`, an ordered `pieces[]` list (each with a `url` and `fileSize`), and the `playgo-chunk.crc` path. |
| `app_0`, `app_sc`, ... | The ordered pieces. Concatenated in manifest order, they reconstruct the original finalized package. |
| `app.crc` | PlayGo chunk CRC file for the reassembled image. |

`DiscBackup.ProsperoDiscBackup.Open(path)` parses the manifest and resolves each piece relative to
its directory. `OpenPackageStream` exposes the reassembled image as one seekable stream without
writing it to disk; `ReassembleTo` writes the joined package; `VerifyPackageDigest` checks the joined
stream against the manifest SHA-256; `ReadPackage` / `ReadContentInfo` parse the reassembled image
directly. The embedded CNT of a split retail image lives in the `app_sc` piece tail, so content-info
resolves only after reassembly.

## 11. Reading and extracting a package

`PKG.ProsperoPackageExtractor` is the read side of the creation pipeline:

- `Inspect(path)` reports package type, whether the outer image is encrypted, the outer offset/size,
  and whether a supplied key is required — without decrypting.
- `ListFiles(...)` walks the inner PFS directory.
- `Extract(...)` unpacks to a directory. A debug/passcode image is opened from public inputs: the
  EKPFS is `ComputeKeys(content-id, passcode, index = 1)` (SHA-256 primary, SHA3-256 fallback), and
  the AES-XTS counter starts at `block_size / 0x1000` so the `0x10000` superblock is plaintext.

`PKG.ProsperoExtractionKey` materializes those EKPFS candidates from a passcode/content-id or accepts
a supplied 32-byte EKPFS. `PFS.ProsperoPfsExtractor` is the reusable single-image walker underneath.

> **Keyed-field boundary.** A finalized retail outer image is encrypted at block 0 with an image
> key delivered through the entitlement/kernel path; it is not derivable from public inputs and not
> brute-forceable. `Inspect` flags such an image as requiring a supplied key and `Extract` refuses
> cleanly rather than emitting corrupt output.
